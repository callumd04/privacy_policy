    <h2>Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h2>
    <p>
      Want to understand your visitor traffic? Vercel Analytics gives you
      first-party, privacy-friendly traffic analytics for your HTML site. This
      template is already configured using the following script:
    </p>

    </p>
    <h2>Integrated with git</h2>
    <p>
      Deploying updates to your site is as simple as
      <code>git push</code> thanks to Vercel's advanced
      <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git">Git Integration</a>.

    <h2>Fast <code>gzip</code> compression</h2>
    <p>
      To help ensure the smallest possible file sizes for your static assets,
      the Vercel Edge Network compresses files by default using
      <code>gzip</code>. You can also optionally use
      <code>brotli</code> compressesion if you prefer.

    </p>
    <h2>Advanced routing configuration</h2>
    <p>
      Vercel gives you a variety of ways to configure the routing of your
      website. For example, adding redirects, rewrites, or headers to your page.
      While you can use <code>vercel.json</code> to define these through JSON,
      you can also express your routing configuration as code using
      <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-middleware"
        >Vercel Edge Middleware</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Middleware runs before the
      <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/edge-network/caching"
        >Vercel Edge Network Cache</a
      >, so you can configure routing exactly as your application needs. For
      example, this template uses <code>middleware.js</code> defined in the root
      of the repository to add additional security headers to the site:
    </p>
    <pre><code>referrer-policy: origin-when-cross-origin
strict-transport-security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
x-content-type-options: nosniff
x-dns-prefetch-control: on
x-frame-options: DENY</code></pre>
